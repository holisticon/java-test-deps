# de.holisticon:java-test-deps   0.1-SNAPSHOT
## Introduction
This is just a dead simple pom that aggregates test dependencies. These are:
- [junit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki)
- [hamcrest]()
- equalsverifier
- mockito

in their current version. That's it.

## Getting started
Put it in your pom and be happy. ;)

## Contribution
Have a neat tool for testing that is not in here? Let us know.
