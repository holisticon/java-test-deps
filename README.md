[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/holisticon/java-test-deps.png)](https://travis-ci.org/holisticon/java-test-deps)
## Introduction
This is just a dead simple pom that aggregates test dependencies. These are:

- [junit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki)
- [hamcrest](https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/)
- [equalsverifier](https://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/)
- [mockito](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/)

in their current version. That's it.

## Getting started
Put it in your pom and be happy. ;)

## Contribution
